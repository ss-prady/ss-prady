# 👋 Hello there! I'm Pradyuman.

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a curious explorer at the intersection of **systems programming**, **quantum computing**, and **Machine Learning**. I love learning by doing and sharing knowledge along the way.

## 🔧 Current Projects

- 🚀 **Multi-Threaded File Server with Access Control**  
  A robust C/C++ server supporting file uploads/downloads, user authentication, role-based access (read-only/read-write), and secure multi-client communication with logging and synchronization.

- 🛠 **SIC/XE Assembler Implementation**  
  Exploring the classic SIC/XE architecture from scratch — covering everything from instruction formats and program blocks to loaders and debugging tools. Documented with detailed, in-depth commentary for fellow learners.

## 📚 Interests

- 🧠 **Quantum Computing**  
  Delivering talks and building a foundational understanding of quantum algorithms and qubits.

- 📜 **Indian Knowledge Systems**  
  Involved with IIT Roorkee’s Center for Indian Knowledge Systems and the Sanskrit Club. Hosting and anchoring guest lectures blending traditional wisdom with modern science.

- 🧵 **Systems Programming**  
  Passionate about writing clean, efficient C/C++ code and diving deep into OS-level constructs like threads, file locks, sockets, and memory management.
